This is a kiss-compliant repo structure to build LLVM.

To build LLVM compiler infrastructure from scratch (and without any
traces of GCC), you'll need these.

Packages with @ in front of them denotes temporary bootstrap packages,
you may safely uninstall them after you built the main LLVM package.

This repo is only tested for x86_64, other architectures may need
additional configurations.

NOTE: This is what I could do, however, if you can find a better way
      that doesn't require 2 passes to clang, patches welcome! Also,
      some required packages may be missing.

See respective build files for more information.

Installation order as follows:
1.  @llvm-pass1
2.  @clang-pass1
3.  @compiler-rt
4.  @libunwind
5.  @libc++abi
6.  @libc++
7.  @llvm-pass2
    - NOTE: remove @llvm-pass1 before installing @llvm-pass2
8.  @clang-pass2
    - NOTE: remove @clang-pass1 before installing @clang-pass2
9.  @lld
