________________________________________________________________________

This is a kiss-compliant repository structure to build LLVM without any
traces of GCC libraries. It also provides any alternatives for official
KISS packages that cannot be built with LLVM.


Building kiss-llvm
________________________________________________________________________

To build LLVM compiler infrastructure from scratch (and without any
traces of GCC), you'll need these.

Packages with @ in front of them denotes temporary bootstrap packages,
you may safely uninstall them after you built the main LLVM package.

This repo is only tested for x86_64, other architectures may need
additional configurations.

NOTE: This is what I could do, however, if you can find a better way
      that doesn't require 2 passes to clang, patches welcome! Also,
      some required packages may be missing.

See respective build files for more information.

Installation order as follows:
1. @llvm-pass1
2. @clang-pass1
3. @compiler-rt
4. @libunwind
5. @libc++abi
6. @libc++
7. @clang-pass2
   - NOTE: remove @clang-pass1 before installing @clang-pass2

Recommended: Since downloading files repeatedly is a waste of bandwidth
             (especially if you have a slow Internet), you can use these
             commands to symlink thesource cache (usually located in
             $HOME/.cache/kiss/sources):

$ ln -s llvm @llvm-pass1
$ ln -s llvm @clang-pass1
$ ln -s llvm @clang-pass2
$ ln -s llvm @compiler-rt
$ ln -s llvm @llvm-libunwind
$ ln -s llvm @libc++abi
$ ln -s llvm @libc++

And make sure to download the main LLVM package sources first and NOT
the bootstrap packages (by using `kiss c` in the llvm directory, or by
using `kiss c llvm` after adding the kiss-llvm directory to $PATH, make
sure the checksums are NOT changed, git should be able to track these).

Using LLVM from kiss-llvm
________________________________________________________________________

After installing llvm from kiss-llvm (and uninstalling the temporary
bootstrap packages), you can use the alternatives system to switch to
LLVM-provided binutils (except as).

Because programs might still detect GCC and use it, you can force Clang
by applying environment variables CC=cc and CXX=c++ after applying the
alternatives. (For some packages like Busybox, you may need to
explicitly use CC=clang, as they explicitly detect Clang through the
name of the binary)

Also, you will need to rebuild every single package that links to
/lib/libstdc++.so, a small way to check if a library or a program links
to libstdc++ using the shell as follows:

$ for file in /usr/bin/* /usr/lib/*; do
      echo FILE: "$file"       # This is as an identifier of which file
      ldd "$file" | grep libstdc++
  done

You may also need to check if any packages link to libatomic.so and
libgcc_s.so.

You can use kiss-owns to check which file belongs to which package, and
rebuild that.

Note: Even if you have clang with libc++ and LLVM binutils,
      unfortunately you can't remove gcc from base if you have rust,
      since rust's bootstrap still dynamically link libgcc (and you
      need patches AND provide your own bootstrap package [1]).

If you think replacing just the compiler and the binutils is not enough,
head on over to Wyverkiss [2] since the distribution also removes the
need for GNU bison and many others (GNU make cannot be removed though).
